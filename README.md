# I - Ansible Setup on wmware with RHEL

# II - Inventory in Ansible
### 1 - What is Ansible?
```
Ansible is a free and open source engine that automates remotes system and ensures they meet the desired state. It establishes connection between node using SSH.
```
### 2 - What is Control Node?
```
Control Node is the machine where Ansible is installed.
```
### 3 - What  is Managed Node?
```
Managed Node is a host or system that is managed by the Control Node.
```
### 4 - What is Playbook?
```
Playbook is a Yammel configuration file that uses a human readable language to describe automation jobs.
```
### 5 - What is an **inventory**?
```
An inventory is a file that lists the hosts(servers) that you want Ansible to manage.
```
### 6 - Create an inventory
```
sudo mkdir ansible
cd ansible
vim invertory.ini
```
# III - Ansible configuration file
### a - What is a configuration file in Ansible?
```
In Ansible, configuration file is used to defined various settings that control how Ansible operates. It typically named ansible.cfg .
```
### b - Create Ansible configuration file
```
cd ansible
vim ansible.cfg
```
### c - Details of the configuration file

##### *[defaults]*
   - Section that sets the default behavior of Ansible when running a **playbook** or **ad-hoc commands**.

##### *inventory= ./inventory.ini* 
 - Tell Ansible to use **inventory.ini** in the current directory as the inventory file.
 - This file lists the **hosts** that Ansible is going to manage.
 - This file can be in **ini** or **yaml** format.

##### *remote_user = ansible*
 - This is the **default ssh user** Ansible uses to connect to the remote hosts.

 ##### *ask_pass*
  - This tell Ansible **not to ask for the ssh password**.
  - It assumes that you are using **ssh key-based authentification**.

##### *[privilege_escalation]*
 - This controle **how Ansible gets elevated access** on the target machines.

 ##### *become = true*
  - Enables *privilege escalation*.

  ##### *become_method = sudo*
   - The method Ansible uses to escalate privileges.

##### *become_user = root*
- The user Ansible will try to become **root**.

##### *become_ask_pass = false*
 - Tell Ansible **not to prompt for the sudo password** 
 - This will work if the **ansible user** can run sudo **without a password** ( need to add ansible user to the /etc/sudoers with **ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: ALL**).

 # A - Project : Create a Simple File on a Server with Ansible

This project demonstrates how to use Ansible to create a simple file on a remote server.

## Prerequisites

- Ansible installed on your control node.
- SSH access to the target server(s).
- Inventory file listing the target hosts.

## Ansible Playbook
```
- name: Create a simple file on a serverb
  hosts: serverb
  tasks:
    - name: Create a simple file with content on serverb
      file:
        path: /tmp/file-playbook1
       state: touch
```
# B - Project: Apache Installation with Ansible
This project uses Ansible to automate the installation and configuration of the Apache HTTP server on two server.

üöÄ Requirements
. Ansible installed on your control machine (your laptop or a bastion host)

. SSH access to the target node

. Python installed on the target node

. A user on the target node with sudo privileges

# C - Project: Nginx Installation and User Setup with Hard Link

## üìã Description

This Ansible project  performs the following actions using **two separate plays**:

1. **Play 1**: Installs **Nginx** on the host group named `webserver`.
2. **Play 2**: On a different host group named `otherserver`, it:
   - Creates a Linux user.
   - Creates a file.
   - Creates a **hard link** to the file.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Inventory Setup

Make sure your `inventory.ini` file looks like this:

```ini
[webserver]
192.168.1.10

[otherserver]
192.168.1.20
```
## To check the syntax of an Ansible playbook

```ansible-playbook <playbook_file.yml> --syntax-check```

# D - Project: Ansible Ad Hoc Commands

This project provides a guide on using Ansible ad hoc commands for quick, one-off tasks on remote systems.

## What are Ad Hoc Commands?

Ansible ad hoc commands allow you to execute single tasks on managed nodes without the need for playbooks. They are ideal for tasks you don't perform frequently and provide a quick way to interact with remote systems.

**Key characteristics:**

-   **Single-task execution:** Ad hoc commands execute a single task per command invocation.
-   **Non-reusable:** Unlike playbooks, ad hoc commands are not stored for future reuse.
-   **Fast and simple:** They provide a rapid way to execute tasks across multiple hosts.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for an Ansible ad hoc command is:

```bash
ansible <pattern> -m <module> -a "<module_arguments>"
# pattern: Defines which hosts to target
# -m <module>: Specifies the Ansible module to use 
# -a "<module_arguments>": Provides the arguments for the chosen module, enclosed in double quotes.

# Examples:
# ansible all -m ping
# ansible webservers -m command -a "uptime"
# ansible appservers -m yum -a "name=http state=present"
```

# E - Project: Ansible Automation: Nginx Uninstallation & User Removal

This Ansible project contains two plays:

1. **Uninstall `nginx`** on a specific host if it is already installed.
2. **Delete user `pauly`**, including their home directory, if the user exists.


## üìú playbook.yml Overview

### üîπ Play 1: Uninstall Nginx (if installed)
- Target: A specific host (define in inventory as `webserver`)
- Checks if `nginx` is installed using `rpm -q`.
- If installed, it uninstalls using the `yum` module.

### üîπ Play 2: Remove User `pauly`
- Target: `otherserver`
- Checks if user `pauly` exists using the `getent` module.
- If the user exists, it deletes the user and their home directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Ansible installed on the control node
- SSH access to target hosts
- `sudo` privileges on managed hosts
- Inventory configured properly

## üß™ Inventory
```
[webserver]
nodeA

[otherserver]
serverb
```
# F - Project: Ansible Role: Delete User If Exists

This Ansible playbook uses a **handler** to check if a user exists on the system, and deletes the user along with their home directory if they do.

## üìå Features

- Check if a user exists using Ansible facts.
- Use a handler to delete the user and their home directory.
- Clean and modular role structure.
- Simple to integrate with other playbooks.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.yml          # Handler that deletes the user
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/
